Viaduct is open-source, meaning that you can make as many copies of it as you want and do whatever you want with
those copies, without limitation. But Viaduct is not open-contribution. It was built for one user, and it's being
maintained for that user only.  Also, in order to keep Viaduct in the public domain and ensure that the code does
not become contaminated with proprietary or licensed content, the project does not accept patches from unknown
persons.
